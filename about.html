      My dearest Salma, from the depths of my heart, I want to apologize for
      what happened last night. I never meant to hurt you, and it breaks my
      heart knowing that I caused you any pain. You mean the world to me, and I
      deeply regret my actions. Please forgive me fully, with all your heart. I
      promise to always cherish, respect, and love you in the way you truly
      deserve. You are the light of my life, the one who makes everything better
      just by being in it. I cannot bear the thought of losing your trust, and I
      will do everything I can to prove that my love for you is genuine and
      unwavering. You are so special to me, and I hope we can move past this
      together, stronger and more in love than ever before. I love you with all
      my heart, and I will wait for your forgiveness, no matter how long it
      takes.
